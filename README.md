# 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction App

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. Built using Streamlit and trained on a medical dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a reliable model that can assist in early detection of Parkinson’s disease using measurable voice parameters, enabling faster diagnosis.
